These JSON templates are **intentionally deterministic** so your AI can:

* Generate MIDI deterministically
* Vary difficulty programmatically
* Cross-map skills between genres
* Attach scoring, timing, and harmonic validation

If you want, next we can:

* Normalize this into a single master schema
* Add per-week MIDI constraints (range, density, rhythm)
* Add assessment rubrics per genre
* Build the generator prompts per exercise type
