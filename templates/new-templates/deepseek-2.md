# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR YOUR APP
# ============================================================================

"""
HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS MASTERY SYSTEM IN YOUR APP:

1. CURRICULUM DATABASE:
- Store these templates in a database with relationships
- Each curriculum should have:
     * Prerequisite map
    * Skill dependency graph
        * Assessment checkpoints
            * Resource library links

2. STUDENT PROGRESSION ENGINE:
- Track each student's position in multiple curriculums
    - Calculate skill mastery percentages
        - Predict time to completion
            - Suggest optimal next steps

3. AI EXERCISE GENERATOR:
- Use the generation rules to create infinite variations
    - Adapt difficulty based on student performance
        - Generate MIDI files with proper style characteristics

4. PERFORMANCE ANALYZER:
- Analyze recordings for:
     * Note accuracy
    * Rhythmic precision
        * Dynamic range
            * Articulation consistency
                * Style authenticity

5. VIRTUAL MASTER CLASS MODULE:
- AI teachers that demonstrate techniques
    - Interactive duet mode
        - Style imitation analysis
            - Historical context teaching

6. PRACTICE PLANNER:
- Generate optimal daily practice plans
    - Balance technical vs musical work
        - Schedule review and consolidation
            - Track consistency and progress

7. COMMUNITY AND MENTORSHIP:
- Connect students at similar levels
    - Peer review system
        - Master teacher access
            - Performance opportunities

8. CERTIFICATION SYSTEM:
- Official assessments at each level
    - Digital badges for achievements
        - Performance video submissions
    - Master teacher evaluations

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Backend:
- Python / Django or FastAPI
    - PostgreSQL with JSON fields for curriculum data
        - Redis for caching exercise generation
            - Celery for background MIDI generation
                - TensorFlow / PyTorch for AI analysis models

Frontend:
                - React / Next.js for web app
                    - React Native for mobile
                        - Web Audio API for real - time analysis
                            - MIDI.js for browser MIDI playback
                                - D3.js for progress visualizations

Audio Processing:
                    - LibROSA for audio analysis
                        - PrettyMIDI for MIDI manipulation
                            - FluidSynth for sound generation
                                - Audio processing pipelines for feedback

AI / ML Components:
    - Transformer models for exercise generation
        - CNN for performance analysis
            - Reinforcement learning for adaptive curricula
                - NLP for theory question answering
